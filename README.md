# React Tic-Tac-Toe
License: ``MIT``

Project Status: ``Completed``

This project was part of a Web Development Bootcamp to build out a basic Tic Tac Toe app within ReactJS. This has been enhanced with the integration of playing against the computer with a replay feature.

## How to get started

``npm install`` - Install all node packages to run the application

``npm start`` - Start development instance of the application

``npm build`` - Build a production instance of the application

## Note

This application was orginally built using ``Create-React-App`` which has now been deprecated. Efforts have been made to ensure the application has minimal security vulnerabilities but no guarantee of the application being fully without vunerabilities due to its age.
